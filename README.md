# Neural Network code to perform energy, force, Hessian computations based on graph convolution 

## Getting Started 
First you need to set up your environment with the necessary python intall. This code is developed to be compatible with [graphbuilder](https://github.mit.edu/MLMat/graphbuilder) by William Harris. However the code is still under development, so please be sure to clone wujie branch to be compatible 

be sure to install the packages in the following way. 

### install required packages(It is advised that you create an new environment to intall alls the packages)

pytorch:



### clone Repos

set up directories. (You don't have to do this, just change the import paths when you run test in the notebook)
`cd ~/
make Repo
cd Repo
mkdir projects
cd projects
`

clone graphbuilder (wujie branch)
`git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> host:git@github.mit.edu:MLMat/graphbuilder.git`

clone NeuralForceField Code (master branch)
`git clone git@github.mit.edu:MLMat/NeuralForceField.git`

You will find two directories `NeuralForceField` and graphbuilder
